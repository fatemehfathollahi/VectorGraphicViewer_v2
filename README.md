# Project Title

This is a simple vector graphic viewer project.

## Description
This project is implemented using .NET 4.7.2 and the WPF framework. 
Initially, I started the project with .NET 6, 
but I faced the issue of not having a compatible library for testing with this version.
Therefore, I had to create a new project with a lower version and copy the necessary changes.
Finally, I pushed the changes to a new repository.
